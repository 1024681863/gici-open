gici version 1.0.0 (2023.02.18)
Initial version.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gici version 1.0.1 (2023.03.04)
  ADDED   : Measurement data realignment to ensure measurement timestamp ascending.
  ADDED   : Backend pending check and measurement data sparsifying.
  FIXED   : Jamming on image frontend thread.
  FIXED   : Rank deficiency when computing yaw STD before the visual estimator 
            has been initialized.
  FIXED   : Unstable output when aligning output tag to non-propagation sensors.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gici version 1.0.2 (2023.03.12)
  FIXED   : Errors on GNSS logger.
  CHANGED : Treat GPS L2C as L2.
  CHANGED : GNSS observation handle strategy.
  FIXED   : Negative doppler for tersus and novatel raw data.
  FIXED   : Wrong ionosphere delay computation in pseudorange factor.
  FIXED   : Frequently recompute code biases, which causes large computational load.
  ADDED   : Detail information for residual logging.
  ADDED   : Function deNormalizeResidual for all error factors
  CHANGED : Use denormalized reisudal to apply GNSS measurement rejections.
  CHANGED : Force SPP using single frequency.
  CHANGED : Force DGNSS and SDGNSS using all the frequencies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gici version 1.0.3 (2023.04.03)
  ADDED   : Add check on phase bias validity.
  CHANGED : Set small value to max_iteration in RTK and PPP, we do not need too 
            many iterations.
  FIXED   : Large time cosumption in GNSS estimator when rejecting outliers.
  ADDED   : start_message option for input streamers to send start-up messages 
            to the source.
  FIXED   : Cannot detect cycle-slip for SD and DD formulations.
  CHANGED : Delete SPP in GNSS tightly estimators.
  FIXED   : Cannot find parameter in phaserange rejection.
  FIXED   : Insufficient satellite in TC and RRR estimators.
  ADDED   : Strategies to check if estimator is under divergence or abnormal status.
  ADDED   : Some tools for file edit and format exchanging.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gici version 1.0.4 (2023.04.07)
  CHANGED : Update default ionosphere parameter to 2023.01.01.
  CHANGED : Reject pseudorange together with the corresponding ambiguity parameter(s) 
            for PPP and RTK estimators.
  ADDED   : GxESD message to output STD for NMEA
  CHANGED : No longer need to enter the hour item for start_time option in RTCM formator.
  ADDED   : SPP/IMU TC estimator and SPP/IMU/Camera RRR estimator.
  ADDED   : Some tools to support converting data to rosbag.
